# COMP1100/1130 Assignment 2, Semester 1 2022

In this assignment, you will write code to explore some simple
computational models called [Cellular
Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton). A
cellular automaton is a grid of cells, and a rule that describes how
cells change over discrete time steps. These can be used to (crudely)
model all sorts of interesting things, like biological systems,
electronics and liquids. The opening ten or so minutes of the [Noita
GDC talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prXuyMCgbTc) show some
clever effects built out of simple rules.

{:.msg-info}
This assignment is worth 12% of your final grade.

**Deadline**: Wednesday 4 May, 2022, at 11:00pm Canberra time *sharp*

## Required Knowledge

Students who have worked up to the [Week 6 lab]({% link _labs/06.md %}) should have the
programming knowledge required for this assignment; in particular you will need to work
with recursion and parametric polymorphism.
The [Week 7 lab]({% link _labs/07.md %}) will help you improve your unit test and style
marks.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the assignment repository and create a project for it in
   VSCodium, following the same steps as in [Lab
   2]({% link _labs/02.md %}. The
   assignment repository is at
   <https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp1100/2022s1/2022s1studentfiles/assignment2>.

2. Add **our** version of the repository as a *remote* called
   `upstream`. This allows us to provide additional fixes in the unlikely case that they
   are required. You do this by doing the following:
   - Go to the command palette in VSCode (or VSCodium) by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + p`
   - Type `git remote`
   - Click **Git: Add Remote**
   - Enter `upstream` into the box for the remote name
   - Put the following URL as the remote url: `https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp1100/2022s1/2022s1studentfiles/assignment2.git`.

## Overview of Tasks

{:.msg-warn}
From this assignment onward, code that does not compile and run will be penalised heavily. This means that **both** the commands `cabal v2-run automata` **and** `cabal v2-test` must run without errors. If **either** if those commands fails with an error, a heavy mark deduction will be applied. The deduction will be the same regardless of which these
commands fails. If you have a partial solution that you cannot get working, you
should comment it out and write an additional comment directing your
tutor's attention to it.

## Overview of the Repository

For COMP1100 students, most of your code will be written in
`src/Automata.hs`, and a little
in `src/TestPatterns.hs`.
You will also need to implement tests in
`src/AutomataTest.hs`, which contains some example tests for you to
study.
COMP1130 students will also need to write code in `src/App.hs`.

### Other Files

* `src/TestPatterns.hs` contains some test patterns for the automata
  in this assignment.

* `src/Testing.hs` is the testing library we used in Assignment 1. You
  should read this file as well as `src/AutomataTest.hs`, and make sure
  you understand how to write tests.

* `src/GridRenderer.hs` contains code to render a grid of cells to the
  screen, and to convert a point on the screen back into a grid
  coordinate. You are not required to understand it, but it is heavily
  commented for interested students to read.

* `src/App.hs` contains the bulk of a small CodeWorld test program
  that uses your automata code. We discuss its features in "Overview
  of the Test Program".

* `app/Main.hs` launches the test application.

* `test/Main.hs` is a small program that runs the tests in
  `src/AutomataTest.hs`.

* `comp1100-assignment2.cabal` tells the cabal build tool how to build
  your assignment. You are not required to understand this file, and
  we will discuss how to use cabal below.

* `Setup.hs` tells cabal that this is a normal package with no unusual
  build steps. Some complex packages (that we won't see in this
  course) need to put more complex code here. You are not required to
  understand it.

## Overview of Cabal

As before, we are using the `cabal` tool to build the assignment
code. The commands provided are very similar to last time:

* `cabal v2-build`: Compile your assignment.

* `cabal v2-run automata`: Build your assignment (if necessary), and
  run the test program.

* `cabal v2-repl comp1100-assignment2`: Run the GHCi interpreter over
  your project.

* `cabal v2-test`: Build and run the tests. This assignment is set up
   to run a unit test suite like in Assignment 1, but this time you
   will be writing the tests. The unit tests will abort on the first
   failure, or the first call to a function that is `undefined`.

{:.msg-info}
You should execute these cabal commands in the **top-level directory** of your
project: `~/comp1100/assignment2` (i.e., the directory you are in when you
launch a terminal from VSCodium).


## Overview of the Test Program

The test program in `app/Main.hs` uses CodeWorld, just like Assignment
1, and responds to the following keys:

| Key          | Effect                                          |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `1`          | Reset the simulation to the first test pattern  |
| `2`          | Reset the simulation to the second test pattern |
| `3`          | Reset the simulation to the third test pattern  |
| `Q`          | Switch to Fransson's QR World (COMP1130 only)   |
| `.`          | Evolve one generation of the simulation         |
| `<Spacebar>` | Evolve multiple generations of the simulation   |
| `+`          | Make `<Spacebar>` evolve more generations       |
| `-`          | Make `<Spacebar>` evolve fewer generations      |

You can also click on cells with the mouse to change them, if you want
to play around with different patterns.

{:.msg-warn}
If you try to use the test program without completing Task 1, or you
try to run the simulation before completing Task 2, the test program
may crash with the following error:

```
"Exception in blank-canvas application:"
Prelude.undefined
```

If this happens, refresh the browser to continue.


## Overview of Cellular Automata

A cellular automaton is a simulation made up of a grid of cells. The
simulation proceeds in discrete time-steps: to compute the next
generation of the simulation, we apply a _rule_ to each cell according to its state, and
the state of its _neighbourhood_.
The notion of neighbourhood can be different for different cellular automata;
in this assignment we mean the immediate orthogonal neighbours
(up, down, left, and right, but not diagonal).

In this assignment, you will be implementing a cellular automaton presented by
[Erik Fransson](https://research.chalmers.se/en/person/erikfr) as _QR World_ in
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsszVOcxRIw) (more precisely, we will
be implementing the part of his automaton that he colours blue in the video).


### Fransson's QR World

A cellular automaton can be described by the rules that dictate the evolution of the
simulation. The rules of QR World have a (vaguely) biological intepretation:

* Cells can be _alive_ or _dead_.
* If a cell is _alive_:
  - If fewer than two of its neighbours are _alive_, it gets lonely and becomes _dead_.
  - If all four of its neighbours are _alive_, it gets overcrowded and
    becomes _dead_.
  - All other _alive_ cells (those with two or three _alive_ neighbours)
    remain _alive_.
* If a cell is _dead_:
  - If it has two or four _alive_ neighbours, they breed and the cell becomes _alive_.
  - All other _dead_ cells remain _dead_.

These rules produce a kaleidoscope of interesting patterns and
behaviours, given different starting patterns of dead and alive cells.


#### Test Patterns

The Test Patterns given in this assignment will allow you to observe some of the variety
of behaviour that the QR World can display.

Test Patterns 1 and 2 start with small images of the numbers _1100_ and _1130_
respectively. Test Pattern 1 will get into a loop from steps 4 and 5 on (in other words,
the automaton after steps 6,8,10,... are identical to the automaton after step 4, and the
automaton after steps 7,9,11,... are identical to the automaton after step 5).
Test Pattern 2 reaches a fixed point after step 6 (i.e. all later steps do not change the automaton).

Test Pattern 3 provides a more complex and pretty display of a collapsing spiral.

## Task 1: Types and Helper Functions (COMP1100: 25 Marks; COMP1130: 20 Marks)

Before we can begin implementing the rules for our cellular automata,
we need to set up a few things:

1. Data types to represent each sort of cell;
2. Helper functions over cells; and
3. Helper functions for our `Grid` data type.

The assignment framework will use these functions to render entire
grids of cells to CodeWorld `Picture`s.


### Your Tasks

In `src/Automata.hs`, fill out the data type `QRCell` that represents
cells in QR World. Defining our own type to talk about cells
lets us be precise when we code, which reduces bugs.

In `src/TestPatterns.hs`, there are two test patterns for QR World,
expressed as `String`s. The `parseGrid` function
_parses_ these strings into values of type `Grid QRCell`, which are
made available to the rest of the program. (_Parsing_ is the process
of analysing unstructured data - usually strings or binary data - and
converting it into a more structured form.)

`parseGrid` relies on a helper function to parse individual characters
into cells. For QR World, the helper is `toQR :: Char ->
QRCell`, which you need to implement. It shall turn a character from a
QR test pattern into a QR cell, according to the following
rule:

  - An `'A'` character represents an _alive_ cell.
  - Any other character represents a _dead_ cell.

We provide a test program that uses CodeWorld to draw the cells to the
screen, and allows you to edit the grid by clicking on it. It relies
on some helper functions in `src/Automata.hs`, which you need to
implement:

* The test program allows the user to change cells by clicking on
  them. This relies on `cycleQR :: QRCell -> QRCell`, which
  returns what the cell should be after it is clicked. This function
  needs to return the "next" type of QR cell, similar to
  `nextColour` from Assignment 1. The "next" of an _alive_ cell is a
  _dead_ cell, and the "next" of a _dead_ cell is an _alive_ cell.

* The test program knows how to draw a `Grid` of cells, provided that
  it can be told how to draw a single cell from the grid. It uses
  `renderQR :: QRCell -> Picture` to do this, which needs to
  behave according to the following rules:

  - _Dead_ cells shall be drawn as hollow black rectangles, 1x1 in
    size, centred at the origin.

  - _Alive_ cells shall be drawn as solid blue rectangles, 1x1 in
    size, centred at the origin.

The test program requires two more helpers in `src/Automata.hs` that
deal with the grid as a whole. You might also find them useful in Task
2:

* `get :: Grid c -> GridCoord -> Maybe c`

  - The test program uses `get` when it responds to mouse clicks, to
    pick out the cell that the user is changing.

  - `get g (x,y)` shall return `Just` the cell at position `(x,y)`, if
    it exists. If it does not (i.e., `x` or `y` are outside the bounds
    of the `Grid`), it shall return `Nothing`.

  - Both `x` and `y` count from `0`. That is, `(0,0)` is the top-left
    corner of the grid.

  - The cells in a `Grid` are stored as a single list, in what we call
    _row-major_ order. This means that the list contains every cell in
    row `0`, then every cell in row `1`, then every cell in row `2`,
    and so on...

* `allCoords :: Int -> Int -> [GridCoord]`

  `allCoords width height` shall return a list of every possible
  coordinate in a grid of that width and height, in row-major
  order. It is important that you emit coordinates in this order, as
  the assignment skeleton assumes that the list of cells in a grid is
  stored in the same order. The renderer in the test program uses
  `allCoords` to decide where to place the `Picture` of each cell in
  the grid.

  Both `width` and `height` must be positive integers to return a
  sensible result. Raise an error if either are zero or negative.

  - Example: `allCoords 3 2` shall return
    `[(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(0,1),(1,1),(2,1)]`.

### Hint

* The function `(!!) :: [a] -> Int -> a` can return the `n`th element
  of a list:

  - Example: `['a', 'b', 'c'] !! 2` returns `'c'`.

  - Example: `[] !! 0` throws an error, as the index is beyond the
    length of the list.

  - You don't want to use this function often (because of the risk of
    errors), but it is a handy tool here.


## Task 2: Running Cellular Automata (COMP1100: 35 Marks; COMP1130: 30 Marks)

We can now render the cellular automata grids in CodeWorld. The next
step is to make them evolve according to Fransson's rules.

### Your Task

Define the following two functions in `src/Automata.hs`:

* `nextGenQR :: Grid QRCell -> Grid QRCell` computes the next
  generation of QR World according to its _rule_; and

* `evolveQR :: Int -> Grid QRCell -> Grid QRCell`, which evolves
  the grid a given number of times. If given a negative number,
  `evolveQR` shall raise an error.

### Hints

* Break the problem down into subproblems (separate functions), and
  test each in isolation. If you find a function does not do what you
  expect, you will have smaller units of code to debug. This is easier
  to get your head around.

* Here are some questions you might need to ask when formulating a
  solution; some of them could be turned into helper functions:

  - Given a coordinate for a cell on a grid, what is its
    _neighbourhood_ (the four cells around that coordinate: one step
    up, down, left, and right)?

    **Style Note:** You can split complex expressions over multiple
    lines, for readability:

    ```haskell
    -- This calculation is pointless but long.
    -- Instead of writing it out like this:
    fiveFactorials = [1, 1 * 2, 1 * 2 * 3, 1 * 2 * 3 * 4, 1 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 5]

    -- Why not write it out like this?
    fiveFactorials =
      [ 1
      , 1 * 2
      , 1 * 2 * 3
      , 1 * 2 * 3 * 4
      , 1 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 5
      ]

    -- P.S.: Did you notice the bug?
    -- It's easier to see in the second example, isn't it?
    ```

  - Given a _neigbourhood_, how many cells are of some particular
    type?

  - Given a _cell_ and its _neighbourhood_, what will the next cell
    look like?

* Do the helper functions from Task 1 solve any of your subproblems?

* The list of cells within a `Grid c` is in row-major order. The list
  of coordinates returned by `allCoords` is in row-major order. Can
  you do anything useful by using both simultaneously?


## Task 3: Custom Automaton (COMP1130 Only: 20 Marks)

Cellular automata can be used to model a wide variety of systems. In
this task, we challenge you to invent an automaton of your own to
model some (probably physical) process.

### Your Task

Think of a physical process or the behaviour of some system. Define a
cellular automaton to simulate that process/system, and implement it
in the assignment framework, including all the functionality that was
implemented for QR World in the earlier parts of the
assignment.

{:.msg-warn}
We expect to make serious changes to the setup for QR World in order to receive
a decent mark. You might have a different set of possible states
for a cell, and a different definition of neighbourhood, for example incorporating
diagonals or cells that are nearby but not adjacent.
We also require your automaton to be at least as complex as QR World itself.
One might model the vacuum of space using cells that are all `Empty`, and
always stay `Empty`, but this is not going to get you many marks!

You will need to:

* Define a data type for its cells. Traditional cellular automata tend
  to use enumerations for the cell type, but you are free to use the
  full power of Haskell's algebraic data types where that makes sense
  in your simulation.

* Define a _rule_ for your automaton, which should consider only the
  current cell and its neighbours. The rule for QR World
  considers the cells in a neighbourhood without regard to direction;
  if your simulation models processes like gravity or buoyancy, your
  _rule_ can check things like "the cell above".

* Define a function that computes the next generation of your
  automaton.

* Define a function that evolves your automaton an integer number of
  steps.

* Define a rendering function for your cell type. So long as the
  `Picture` it produces is 1x1 CodeWorld units in size, the renderer
  will render the entire grid correctly.

* Define two test patterns in `src/TestPatterns.hs` for your
  automaton.

* Make all of the above work with the test program in
  `src/App.hs`. The user needs to be able to:

  - Use the keyboard to switch between QR World and your automaton;
  - Select either of your test patterns, using the existing key bindings;
  - Advance one step at a time by pressing `.`;
  - Jump forward multiple steps using `<Spacebar>`; and
  - Change the grid by clicking on it (you can decide what's sensible
    here - toggling cells made sense for QR World, but might not for
    your automata).

* Discuss your automaton in your report, making sure to explain how it models
  your chosen process/system.

#### Hints

* When handling the `ClickCell` case in `applyEvent`, use either `at`
  or `setAt` to "update" the grid at one particular cell.

* If you are stuck thinking of a system to model, here are some ideas:

  - Movement of liquids
  - Diffusion of heat or gases
  - Fire
  - Electricity
  - Units moving around a board or battlefield (this seems harder than
    the others - be careful that units don't spontaneously duplicate
    or disappear)

  You are not required to follow any of these suggestions. If you have
  your own exciting idea, then please pursue that!

* When making large changes like this, you can often "follow the
  types". This is a useful procedure for making changes in
  strongly-typed languages like Haskell: make a change to a type and
  then repeatedly attempt to build your program. GHC will issue type
  errors and warnings which tell you where the problems are in the
  rest of your code. As you fix those, and rebuild, you will "push"
  the errors out of your program.


## Unit Tests (10 Marks)

How do you know that the program you've written is correct? GHC's type
checker rejects a lot of invalid programs, but you've written enough
Haskell by now to see that a program that compiles is not necessarily
correct. Testing picks up where the type system leaves off, and gives
you confidence that changing one part of a program doesn't break
others. You have written simple doctests in your labs, but larger
programs need more tests, so the tests you will write for this
assignment will be labelled and organised in a separate file from the
code.

Open `src/AutomataTest.hs`. This file contains a couple of example
test cases, written using a simple test framework defined in
`src/Testing.hs`. These files are heavily commented for your
convenience.

You can run the tests by executing `cabal v2-test`. If it succeeds it
won't print out every test that ran, but if it fails you will see the
output of the test run. If you want to see the tests every time, use
`cabal v2-test --test-show-details=streaming` instead.

### Your Task

Replace the example tests with tests of your own. The tests that you
write should show that the Haskell code you've written in Tasks 1-3
is working correctly.

#### Hints

##### General Hints

* Try writing tests before you write code. Then work on your code
  until the tests pass. Then define some more tests and repeat. This
  technique is called _test-driven development_.

* The expected values in your test cases should be easy to check by
  hand. If the tested code comes up with a different answer, then it's
  clear that the problem is with the tested code and not the test
  case.

* Sometimes it is difficult to check an entire structure that's
  returned from one of your functions. Maybe you can compute some
  feature about your result that's easier to test?

* If you find yourself checking something in GHCi (i.e., `cabal
  v2-repl comp1100-assignment2`), ask yourself "should I make this
  into a unit test?". The answer is often "yes".

* If you are finding it difficult to come up with sensible tests, it
  is possible that your functions are doing too many things at
  once. Try breaking them apart into smaller functions and writing
  tests for each.

##### Technical Hints

* The `assertEqual` and `assertNotEqual` functions will not work on
  the CodeWorld `Picture` type (it has no `Eq` instance). Therefore,
  it is not possible to write tests for `renderQR`.

* If you want to write tests about new types you have defined, add
  `deriving (Eq, Show)` to the end of the type definition, like this:

  ```data MyType = A | B | C deriving (Eq, Show)```

* It is not possible to test for a call to `error` using the tools
  provided in this course.


## Style (10 Marks)

> "[...] programs must be written for people to read, and only
> incidentally for machines to execute."

From the foreword to the first edition of [Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-7.html).

Programming is a brain-stretching activity, and you want to make it as
easy on yourself as possible. Part of that is making sure your code is
easy to read, because that frees up more of your brain to focus on the
harder parts.

Guidance on good Haskell style can be found in [this course's Style
Guide](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1100/resources/04-style/),
and in [lecture
notes](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1100/lectures/05-2-Code_Quality.pdf).

### Your Task

Ensure that your code is written in good Haskell style.


## Technical Report (COMP1100: 20 Marks; COMP1130: 30 Marks)

You are to write a concise [technical
report](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1100/resources/08-reports/)
about your assignment.

The **maximum word count** is **1250** for COMP1100 students, and
**2000** for COMP1130 students. This is a *limit*, not a *quota*; concise presentation
is a virtue.

{:.msg-warn}
Once again: These are not required word counts. They are the **maximum
number of words** that your marker will read. If you can do it in
fewer words without compromising the presentation, please do so.

Your report must be in PDF format, located at the root of your
assignment repository on GitLab and named `Report.pdf`. Otherwise, it
may not be marked, or will be marked but with a penalty. You should
double-check **on GitLab** that this is typed correctly.

The report must have a **title page** with the following items:

* Your name
* Your laboratory time and tutor
* Your university ID


### Content and Structure

Your audience is the tutors and lecturers, who are proficient at programming
and understand most concepts. Therefore you should not, for example, waste
words describing the syntax of Haskell or how recursion works. After reading
your technical report, the reader should thoroughly understand what problem
your program is trying to solve, the reasons behind major design choices in it,
as well as how it was tested. Your report should give a broad overview of your
program, but focus on the specifics of what *you* did and why.

Remember that the tutors have access to the above assignment
specification, and if your report *only* contains details from it then
you will only receive minimal marks. Below is an potential outline for
the structure of your report and some things you might discuss in it.

#### Introduction

If you wish to do so you can write an introduction. In it, give:

* A brief overview of your program:
  - how it works; and
  - what it is designed to do.

* If you have changed the way the controls work, perhaps for an extension,
  or added something that may make your program behave unexpectedly,
  then it would be worth making a note of it here.

This section is particularly relevant to more complicated programs.

#### Content

Talk about why you structured the program the way you did. Below are some
questions you could answer:

* Program design

  - Describe what each relevant function does conceptually. (i.e. how
    does it get you closer to solving the problems outlined in this
    assignment spec?)
  - How do these functions piece together to make the finished
    program? Why did you design and implement it this way?
  - What major design choices did *you* make regarding the functions
    that *you’ve* written and the overall structure of your program?

* Assumptions

  - Describe assumptions you have made about how a user might use the
    program and how this has influenced your design decisions.

* Testing

  - How did you test individual functions?
    - Be specific about this - the tutors know that you have tested
      your program, but they want to know *how*.
    - Describe the tests that prove individual functions on their own
      behave as expected (i.e. testing a function with different
      inputs and doing a calculation by hand to check that the outputs
      are correct).

  - How did you test the entire program? What tests did you perform to
    show that the program behaves as expected in all (even unusual)
    cases?

* Inspiration / external content

  - What resources did you use when writing your program (e.g.,
    published algorithms)?
  - If you have used resources such as a webpage describing an
    algorithm, be sure to cite it properly at the end of your report
    in a ‘References’ section. References do not count to the maximum
    word limit.

#### Reflection

Discuss the reasoning behind your decisions, rather than *what* the
decisions were. You can reflect on not only the decisions you made,
but the process through which you developed the final program:

* Did you encounter any conceptual or technical issues?

  - If you solved them, describe the relevant details of what happened
    and how you overcame them.

  - Sometimes limitations on time or technical skills can limit how
    much of the assignment can be completed. If you ran into a problem
    that you could not solve, then your report is the perfect place to
    describe them. Try to include details such as:
    - theories as to what caused the problem;
    - suggestions of things that might have fixed it; and
    - discussion about what you did try, and the results of these attempts.
    
  This is a great way to gain marks to make up for a not completely successful
  programming experience!

* What would you have done differently if you were to do it again

  - What changes to the design and structure you would make if you
    wrote the program again from scratch?

* Are parts of the program confusing for the reader? You can explain
  them in the report (in this situation you should also make use of
  comments in your code).

* If you collaborated with others, what was the nature of the
  collaboration?  (Note that you are only allowed to collaborate by
  discussing concepts, not sharing solutions.)

  - Collaborating is any discussion or work done together on planning
    or writing your assignment.

* Other info

  - You may like to briefly discuss details of events which were
    relevant to your process of design - strange or interesting things
    that you noticed and fixed along the way.

{:.msg-info}
This is a list of **suggestions**, not requirements. You should only
discuss items from this list if you have something interesting to
write.

### Things to avoid in a technical report

* Line by line explanations of large portions of code. (If you want to
  include a specific line of code, be sure to format as described in
  the "Format" section below.)

* Pictures of code or your IDE.

* Content that is not your own, unless cited.

* Grammatical errors or misspellings. Proof-read it before submission.

* Informal language - a technical report is a professional document, and as
  such should avoid things such as:

  - Unnecessary abbreviations (atm, wrt, ps, and so on), emojis, and
    emoticons; and
  - Stories / recounts of events not relevant to the development of the program.

* Irrelevant diagrams, graphs, and charts. Unnecessary elements will
  distract from the important content. Keep it succinct and focused.

If you need additional help with report writing, [ANU Academic Skills](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/academic-skills/appointments)
have resources to help.


### Format

You are not required to follow any specific style guide (such as APA
or Harvard). However, here are some tips which will make your report
more pleasant to read, and make more sense to someone with a computer
science background.

* Colours should be kept minimal. If you need to use colour, make sure it is
  absolutely necessary.
* If you are using graphics, make sure they are *vector* graphics (that stay
  sharp even as the reader zooms in on them).
* Any code, including type/function/module names or file names, that
  appears in your document should have a monospaced font (such as
  Consolas, Courier New, Lucida Console, or Monaco)
* Other text should be set in serif fonts (popular choices are Times,
  Palatino, Sabon, Minion, or Caslon).
* When available, automatic *ligatures* should be activated.
* Do not use underscore to highlight your text.
* Text should be at least 1.5 spaced.

## Communicating

**Do not** post your code publicly, either on Piazza or via other
forums. Posts on Piazza trigger emails to all students, so if by
mistake you post your code publicly, others will have access to your
code and you may be held responsible for plagiarism.

Once again, and we cannot stress this enough: **do not post your code
publicly** . If you need help with your code, post it *privately* to the
instructors.

When brainstorming with your friends, **do not share code**. There
might be pressure from your friends, but this is for both your and
their benefit. Anything that smells of plagiarism will be investigated
and there may be serious consequences.

Sharing concepts and sketches is perfectly fine, but sharing should stop
before you risk handing in suspiciously similar solutions.

Course staff will not look at assignment code unless it is posted
**privately** in piazza, or shared in a drop-in consultation.

Course staff will typically give assistance by asking questions,
directing you to relevant exercises from the labs, or definitions and
examples from the lectures.

{:.msg-info}
Before the assignment is due, course staff will not give individual
tips on writing functions for the assignment or how your code can be
improved. We will help you get unstuck by asking questions and
pointing you to relevant lecture and lab material. You will receive
feedback on your work when marks are released.

## Submission Checklist

Once you have finished your assignment, and preferably 24 hours prior
to the deadline, you should make sure that:

* You have fully read and understand the entire assignment
  specification.
* Your work has been pushed to GitLab. You can confirm that the latest version of your code
  has been pushed to
  GitLab by using your browser to visit
  https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/uXXXXXXX/assignment2, where XXXXXXX
  is your student number.
* Your program compiles and runs, including the `cabal v2-test` test suite.
* Your program works on the lab machines - if the program does not
  work on the lab machines, it might fail tests used by the
  instructors. You can use the [VDI](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1100/resources/02-working-remotely/) for these tests.
* You have proof-read and spell-checked your report.
* The report is in PDF format, located at the root of your project on
  GitLab and named `Report.pdf`. That capital `R` is important - Linux
  uses a case-sensitive file system. Otherwise, it may not be marked.
  Check that this has been done successfully **on Gitlab**.
